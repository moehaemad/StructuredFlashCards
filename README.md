Structured Flash Cards
======================

This is a toy idea that I have been wanting to implement for some time but mainly to reinforce my knowledge of the Java language. I ended up learning a lot more about Android App development than intended which is its own breadth of knowledge.

#####Tech Stack Used:
* Android (Java)
* AWS Website API
* AWS PostgreSQL RDS with CRUD operations

###The app can be found by clicking on the Play Store image:
